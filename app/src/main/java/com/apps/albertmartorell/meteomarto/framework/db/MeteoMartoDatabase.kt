/**
 *
 * The database below defines a class that has 7 tables and 1 DAO class that is used to access it.
 * There is no limit on the number of Entity or Dao classes but they must be unique within the Database.
 *
 * Instead of running queries on the database directly, you are highly recommended to create Dao classes.
 * Using Dao classes will allow you to abstract the database communication in a more logical layer which will be much easier to mock in tests (compared to running direct SQL queries).
 * It also automatically does the conversion from Cursor to your application data classes so you don't need to deal with lower level database APIs for most of your data access.
 * Room also verifies all of your queries in Dao classes while the application is being compiled so that if there is a problem in one of the queries, you will be notified instantly.
